# practicum_modules
Repository for any functions and classes during practicum with Bracket Voodoo and Lot 10. Code relates to projects done on NCAA football field control and NCAA basketball system evaluation and generation. 

#### TO DO:
- Separate systems_analysis.py into separate files to better delineate their applications.
- Where possible, rewrite the functions so they are object oriented (likely inheriting from pandas dataframes).
